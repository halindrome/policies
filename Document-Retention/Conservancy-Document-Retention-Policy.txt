Software Freedom Conservancy Document Retention Policy

1 Purpose

Software Freedom Conservancy (“Conservancy”) has adopted a 
document retention and destruction policy (“Policy”) in order to 
define the record retention responsibilities of Conservancy 
officers, staff, and board members for maintaining and 
documenting the storage and destruction of Conservancy's 
documents and records.

2 General Guidelines

Records should not be kept if they are no longer needed for the 
operation of the business or required by law. Unnecessary records 
should be eliminated from the files. The cost of maintaining 
records is an expense which can grow unreasonably if good 
housekeeping is not performed. A mass of records also makes it 
more difficult to find pertinent records.

From time to time, Conservancy may establish retention or 
destruction policies or schedules for additional categories of 
records in order to ensure legal compliance, and also to 
accomplish other objectives, such as cost management. Conservancy 
has identified several categories of documents that warrant 
special consideration; these categories are listed below. While 
Conservancy has established minimum retention periods for these 
categories, the retention of these documents - and of records not 
included in the identified categories - should be determined 
primarily by the application of the General Guidelines affecting 
document retention in this Section, as well as the exception for 
litigation-relevant records described in the next Section and any 
other pertinent factors.

This Policy does not apply to Member Project committees or community volunteers, and is only applicable to Conservancy directors, officers, and staff members.

3 Document Storage Methods

All Conservancy documents are stored electronically in a 
version-controlled repository on a remote server that is backed 
up to drives on our local premises, with the following 
exceptions: 

• Conservancy stores all e-mails on a separate e-mail server

• Conservancy retains hard copies of all contracts executed with 
  parties outside of the United States for at least the full term 
  of each contract

5 Destruction of Documents

All permitted document destruction shall be halted if the

enforcement agency, and routine destruction shall not be resumed 
without the written approval of Conservancy's General Counsel or 
Executive Director. No documents are to be concealed, altered, or 
destroyed with the intent to obstruct a legal investigation or 
litigation.
