To book the flight, I'll likely need the following info.  Feel free to send
it to me in an GPG-encrypted email (or plain text, if you don't care ;):

  * Exact itinerary, including specific flights, airports and time, and be
    sure the total is within the travel policy requirements.

  * Passport Information
      - Full Name, as it appears on the Passport
      - Issue Date
      - Expiration date
      - Country of Issue
      - Gender
      - Date of Birth
  * mobile number (For flight change alters, if you want the)
  * Frequent flyer numbers for major airlines (if you want the miles credited)
