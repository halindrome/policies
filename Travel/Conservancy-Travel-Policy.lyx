\begin_layout Title

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Purpose 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This Travel and Reimbursable Expense Policy (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Policy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) applies to all member projects of the Software Freedom Conservancy (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the Conservancy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and has been created to memorialize the Conservancy's reimbursement policies
 relating to travel and other business expenses incurred by employees, project
 volunteers, and while engaged in business on behalf of, or at the behest
 of, the Project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Conservancy must maintain effective control of business­‐related expenses
 in order to maintain its financial viability and non-profit status.
 As such, the Conservancy expects persons to use good judgment and to claim
 reimbursement for only those expenses that are necessary and reasonable.
 Excessive expenses, including but not limited to luxury accommodations
 and services unnecessary for or unrelated to the furtherance of the Conservancy
's charitable mission are not eligible for reimbursement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any travel that adheres to these policies is considered in‐policy, and does
 not require special approval, so long as the trip has been approved in
 writing by the Conservancy, or by a the leadership committe of a Conservancy
 Member Project (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Project
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) in a regular Project vote.
 The Conservancy and/or a Project via Project vote can limit the travel
 expenses to an amount less than what would otherwise be considered acceptable
 according to this policy.
 If so, the smaller budget is the maximum allowed expense.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Project Leadership Committee Review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Conservancy foresees the need for periodic reasonable exceptions to
 this policy.
 Persons working on behalf of a specific Project seeking an exception to
 this Policy must petition the Project's leadership committee to obtain
 written approval from the Conservancy authorizing the exception.
 Persons working directly on behalf of the Conservancy must seeking an exception
 to the Policy must obtain written approval from the Conservancy authorizing
 the exception.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Project leadership committees are responsible for creating procedures for
 requesting exceptions, and submitting to Conservancy reimbursement requests
 associated with their respective Projects.
 Project leadership commitees are also responsible for making available
 a list of required response times for inquiries, including but not limited
 to, the following two cases: a specific number of days to respond to regular
 reimbursement requests, and a specific number of days to respond to preauthoriz
ation requests.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Overall Airfare Cost 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Domestic travel greater than $750 requires Executive Board approval prior
 to booking, even if all other policy conditions have been met.
 International travel greater than $1,500 requires Executive Board approval
 prior to booking, even if all other policy conditions have been met.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Class of Service 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coach Airfare is the only acceptable class for all flights (domestic and
 international) unless the Executive Board provides a special exception
 and a valid reason.
 Team members may use airline mileage programs only after the lowest logical
 fare is obtained.
 Team members should not book out-of-policy trips (and thus pay a higher
 fare) in order to qualify for a mileage upgrade.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Advance Purchase 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Travel should be booked at least 14 days in advance; any travel booked less
 than 14 days in advance requires preauthorization by the Executive Board.
 Flights beyond 365 days in advance also require preauthorization by the
 Executive Board.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Low Fare
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Project aims to balance cost savings with convenience and considers
 flights that are within $200 of the lowest logical fare to be within policy.
 Any flights greater than $200 over the lowest logical fare require pre-­‐author
ization by the Executive Board.
 The Project will use Kayak.com as the comparison shopping site for determining
 the baseline lowest fare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Reasonable Flights 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Project asks that team members consider other departure times during
 your day of travel as well as longer trips.
 However, it does consider flights with two or more connections as unreasonable
 and does not expect team members to consider those reasonable flight options.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 and require pre-­approval by the Executive Board.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Excess Baggage 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 piece.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Reimbursable Expenses 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

, and only those categories of expenses listed in this document qualify.

 unless a shorter period of time has been defined by the Executive Board
 for the specific expense.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Lodging 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases, the Project may decide to book lodging on behalf of team
 members.
 In this case, Project­‐booked lodging is always considered in­‐policy.
 If a team member wants to stay elsewhere, or self-book at the same location,
 the Project will only reimburse the team member the amount that it would
 otherwise have paid.
 Team members are expected to be cost-conscious and prudent when booking
 lodging for Project approved trips.
 Lodging documentation submitied as part of a reimbursement request must
 include a copy of the hotel invoice detailing all charges (credit card
 receipts alone are unacceptable).
 The Project will not reimburse team members for any costs associated with
 an upgrade of room accommodations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Meals and Entertainment 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meal expenses are reimbursable only for team members, unless preapproved
 by the Executive Board.
 Such expenses can include a gratuity percentage up to 20%.
 Reimbursement for meals is based on actual expenses incurred, up to a limit
 of $70 per person per day.
 In the case of a team member group, one member of the team can pay for
 the entire meal and submit the expense for reimbursement.
 A list of all participants must be included with the reimbursement request.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ground Transportation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ground transportation necessary as part of authorized Project trips is considere
d to be a reasonable expense.
 Public ground transportation, such as taxis, shuttles, buses and municipal
 transit, are generally the most cost-eff­ective options and are the standard
 for eligible ground transportation reimbursements.
 All car rentals require preauthorization by the Executive Board.
 When car rentals have been pre­‐approved, the rental of compact cars is
 encouraged; mid‐size vehicles are authorized when necessary (e.g., when compact­‐
sized vehicles are not available or the number of passengers or volume of
 baggage makes a compact vehicle impractical).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Rail Transportation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 is considered to be a reasonable expense.
 All rail transportation must be in economy class in North America.
